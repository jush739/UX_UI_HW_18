        <h1>Justin Kwong</h1>
        <p>
          Born and raised in San Francisco and commuted weekly between there and
          Sacramento, Justinâ€™s unusual lifestyle has allowed him to adapt and
          create user experiences and UI designs due to his perseverance and
          stamina. He believes in connecting with users and research's
          extensively to make user-based design based on empathizing with the
          user. Justin has used this principle to redesign websites and
          brainstorm app concepts to improve user experience.

          <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
          <p> I believe learning from the users is one of the most important aspects 
            of UX. I am proficient in user interviews, usability testing, and understanding
            user behavior,wants, and needs through observation and task analysis. I typically
             need a smartphone, laptop, pencil and paper, and Zoom to get these done.</p>

          <h3>USER EMPATHY</h3>
          <p>I want users to have the best UX possible, that can be done by really 
            empathizing with them.I am proficient at creating personas, empathy maps,
            journey maps, userscenarios, and storyboards which helps me design around my users.
            After I have conducted many interviews, I typically use Miro, Figma, 
            and Google Spreadsheets to visualize my user empathy.</p>

          <h3>USER DESIGN</h3>
          <p>After having gathered enough data to pinpoint my users. 
            I can design interfaces based on my users pains and gains. 
            I typically use paper and pencil, Figma, and Miro to create 
            low and high fidelity wireframes as well as user flows. I also
            have an understanding of HTML/CSS so I design with knowledge 
            of the current capabilities and limitations of code. </p>
